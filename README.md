# Invasive_Fish_Project

* Imported nearly 120,000 known NationalPark wildlife species from the [National Park Service Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity) and reduced data to to extant fish species
* Scraped additional National Park data from online as well as known fish species non-endemic to each state from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
* Cleaned and joined our scraped data to perform feature exploration
* Choropleth mapped invasive fish species as a percentage of all fish species prevalent in states with National Parks
* Gave a presentation to undergraduate departmental professors on wildlife resource management effectiveness using research on states identified with high invasive ratios
