# Invasive_Fish_Project

* Imported nearly 120,000 known NationalPark wildlife species from Kaggle (link no longer available) and reduced data to to extant fish species
* Scraped National Park location and coordinate data from online
* Also scraped known fish species not endemic to each state from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
* Cleaned and joined our scraped data to perform feature exploration
* Choropleth mapped invasive fish species as a percentage of all fish species prevalent in states with National Parks
* Gave a presentation to undergraduate departmental professors on wildlife resource management effectiveness using research on states identified with high invasive ratios
